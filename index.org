      <h3>Technical Support Agent</h3>
      <p> I have been in IT support for almost 22 years. I started as a helpdesk agent for Sabre supporting the American Airlines customer in Oct of 1997. At this tiume Sabre was under the umbrellas of AMR same as AA. I moved up and became expert in several diferent fields and then was promoted to the SPOC group or second level agent for a specialized group supporting the Sabre customer.  Sabre split from AMR and became it's own company.  A couple of yerars later it split and sold the IT portion of the company to EDS.  Our SPOC group took on a new role and became RDM, Remote Desktop Support.  A few years later EDS was sold to HP.  HP slit into 2 companys and the IT portion became HPE.  About the time that HPE was merging with DXC, AA insourced our group and a few other groups in the IT group we worked with.</p>
      <p> <strong>I am proficient in the following:</strong></p>

    <h3>I love Running</h3>
    <p> I started out walking for exercise and to loose weight and always wanted a little more.  Once I lost enough weight and got to the point to where I could run, I started off small and gradually increased my distance and speed.  I am still working on this always trying to improve and better my last record. <br />
    I have just entered my first 1 mile fun run and will be entering a 5K run in October.</p>
